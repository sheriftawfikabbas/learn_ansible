#Playbooks:
# Playbooks record and execute Ansibleâ€™s configuration, deployment, and orchestration functions. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.
# If Ansible modules are the tools in your workshop, playbooks are your instruction manuals, and your inventory of hosts are your raw material.

#Check the playbook before execution
